Practice writing SQL statements

1. SELECT * FROM COUNTRIES;
2. SELECT DISTINCT COUNTRY FROM CUSTOMERS;
3. SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE SUBSTRING(CUSTOMERID, 1, 2) = "BL";

   SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE CUSTOMERID LIKE "BL%";
4. SELECT * FROM ORDERS LIMIT 100;
5. SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE POSTALCODE IN (1010, 3012, 12209, 05023);
6. SELECT * FROM ORDERS WHERE SHIPREGION IS NOT NULL;
7. SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS ORDER BY COUNTRY, CITY;
8. INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS VALUES ("DINGL");

9. UPDATE ORDERS SET SHIPREGION = 'EUROZONE' WHERE SHIPREGION = 'FRANCE';

10. DELETE FROM ORDERDETAILS WHERE QUANTITY = 1;

11. SELECT MIN(QUANTITY) FROM `ORDER DETAILS`;
    SELECT MAX(QUANTITY) FROM `ORDER DETAILS`;
    SELECT AVG(QUANTITY) FROM `ORDER DETAILS`;
12. SELECT MIN(QUANTITY) FROM `ORDER DETAILS` GROUP BY ORDERID;
    SELECT MAX(QUANTITY) FROM `ORDER DETAILS` GROUP BY ORDERID;
    SELECT AVG(QUANTITY) FROM `ORDER DETAILS` GROUP BY ORDERID;
13. SELECT CUSTOMERID FROM ORDERS WHERE ORDERID = 10290;
14. 
15. SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE REPORTSTO IS NULL;
16. SELECT * FROM EMPLOYESS WHERE REPORTSTO = 2;
